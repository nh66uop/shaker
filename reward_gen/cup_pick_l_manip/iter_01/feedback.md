## I can see from the robot that
Round 1 of the left-arm manipulation stage (`cp_l_m01`) applied this reward to the stage-1 policy, which arrives beside
the cup in the pre-grasp pose and holds it without touching the cup. It ran 1364 epochs, 2.0 hours, and was stopped early
because the run had entered a state from which the envelope can never fire.

**The approach latch collapsed instead of being kept alive.** Far-start episodes fired `approach_done` 0.49 of the time
at the start of the round and 0.06 by epoch 1160: 0.49 -> 0.34 -> 0.31 -> 0.31 -> 0.15 -> 0.11 over the 200-epoch
buckets. The stage-1 policy this round started from had 0.94.

**The cause is in this reward, not in the policy.** The approach shaping term is paid only while the latch is NOT set
(`before_approach * (0.7 * reach + 0.3 * open_hand)`) and nothing in the reward penalises touching the cup before the
latch. Pressing the palm onto the cup maximises the reach term, and that same contact breaks the `no_touch` condition the
environment requires for the latch, so the latch never fires and the shaping income keeps being paid. The measurements
follow exactly that loop: the no-contact condition falls 0.93 -> 0.50, palm contact rises 0.000 -> 0.44, cup tilt rises
0.11 -> 5.26 degrees, while the approach shaping term keeps paying 0.37 per step and the latch term only 0.16.

**Because every closing term is gated on `approach_done`, the grasp was never paid at all.** Digit contact stalled at
0.51 digits (thumb 0.19, index 0.000, ring 0.001), the envelope latch stayed at exactly 0.000 for the whole round, and
lift, airborne fraction and success stayed at 0.000. The five-digit shaping that this round was written for never got a
chance to act.

**The lift terms are gated only on `held` (digit contact), not on the envelope.** They paid 0.003-0.004 per step from
contact alone. Nothing was lifted, but the gating is looser than the task demands.

Placement rejection behaved as designed (0.42 resampled, none failed), the hand never rested on the table (lowest point
0.238 m) and there were no physics errors.

## Feedback for improvement
What to keep from this attempt:
- Counting the digits separately, with the weakest digit scored on its own, so that five digits are worth much more than
  three. This was written to fix the three-digit grasp of the earlier round and it has not been tested yet, because the
  closing terms never paid. Keep it.
- Paying for the finger links on the cup's surface rather than towards its axis, and the palm term.
- Lift income measured from the cup's own starting height, the rise bonus that only pays while the cup is not yet
  airborne, and holding at the goal being worth more than lifting repeatedly.

What has to change, in order of importance:

**Touching the cup before the approach latch must cost something.** There is no contact penalty before the latch, so the
policy maximises the approach shaping by pressing the palm into the cup, which is exactly what stops the environment from
latching. Charge for any finger, thumb or palm contact while `approach_done` is not set, and charge for moving the cup at
all (it tilted 5 degrees this round), the same way the approach stage does.

**Latching must never be a loss of income.** The approach shaping is paid only while the latch is unset, so the policy is
paid to avoid latching. Either keep paying the same shaping after the latch, or make the latch bonus clearly larger than
the shaping it replaces, so that the step on which the latch fires is a step up in reward and stays up.

**The closing terms must not be the only thing behind the gate.** Everything that pays for the grasp is multiplied by
`approach_done`, so when the latch fails the policy sees no path at all towards the task. Give a small, bounded income for
correct pre-grasp geometry with an open hand (the configuration the gate checks) that survives after the latch too, so
there is a continuous slope from arriving to closing.

**Lifting should require the envelope, not just contact.** The lift and rise terms are gated on digit contact alone. Gate
them on `envelope_done` (or on the palm plus four digits), so that a cup dragged upward by a few fingertips does not pay.

One caution. Success, tolerance and lift stayed at zero for this whole round, so nothing can be concluded about the lift
or goal parts of this reward; do not rewrite them in response to those zeros.
