Round 1 of the left-arm manipulation stage (`cp_l_m01`) applied this reward to the stage-1 policy, which arrives beside
the cup in the pre-grasp pose and holds it without touching the cup. It ran 1364 epochs, 2.0 hours, and was stopped early
because the run had entered a state from which the envelope can never fire.

**The approach latch collapsed instead of being kept alive.** Far-start episodes fired `approach_done` 0.49 of the time
at the start of the round and 0.06 by epoch 1160: 0.49 -> 0.34 -> 0.31 -> 0.31 -> 0.15 -> 0.11 over the 200-epoch
buckets. The stage-1 policy this round started from had 0.94.

**The cause is in this reward, not in the policy.** The approach shaping term is paid only while the latch is NOT set
(`before_approach * (0.7 * reach + 0.3 * open_hand)`) and nothing in the reward penalises touching the cup before the
latch. Pressing the palm onto the cup maximises the reach term, and that same contact breaks the `no_touch` condition the
environment requires for the latch, so the latch never fires and the shaping income keeps being paid. The measurements
follow exactly that loop: the no-contact condition falls 0.93 -> 0.50, palm contact rises 0.000 -> 0.44, cup tilt rises
0.11 -> 5.26 degrees, while the approach shaping term keeps paying 0.37 per step and the latch term only 0.16.

**Because every closing term is gated on `approach_done`, the grasp was never paid at all.** Digit contact stalled at
0.51 digits (thumb 0.19, index 0.000, ring 0.001), the envelope latch stayed at exactly 0.000 for the whole round, and
lift, airborne fraction and success stayed at 0.000. The five-digit shaping that this round was written for never got a
chance to act.

**The lift terms are gated only on `held` (digit contact), not on the envelope.** They paid 0.003-0.004 per step from
contact alone. Nothing was lifted, but the gating is looser than the task demands.

Placement rejection behaved as designed (0.42 resampled, none failed), the hand never rested on the table (lowest point
0.238 m) and there were no physics errors.
