# iter_17 — the pour angle is no longer prescribed: only the beads pay

## 1. What the task means and which stages the robot must go through

Twenty beads have to travel from the cup standing in front of the RIGHT (source) hand into the cup
standing in front of the LEFT (receiver) hand, **through the air**. Pushing one cup into the other
transfers nothing — `cups_nested` invalidates the success — so the beads must fall out of a tilted
source cup and land in an upright receiver cup, with little spill and no cup dropped.

Stages:

1. **Approach (both arms, in parallel).** Each hand brings its fingertips onto its own cup — thumb on
   one side, the other tips on the other side — slowly, because a 0.3-0.4 N side push tips these cups
   over. The hand descends through a funnel: arrive ~45 mm above the pinch height, come down only
   once the pinch centre is centred on the cup axis.
2. **Fingertip grasp (both arms).** Thumb AND at least one other finger pressing on the cup
   (`*_grasped`), with the two sides balanced so the cup is squeezed, not pushed over.
3. **Lift (both arms).** Both cups leave the table. The source needs enough height that its rim can
   still sit above the receiver rim after the lip drops during the tilt; the receiver needs only a
   small, steady lift.
4. **Rendezvous.** The two cups come together horizontally, in the source arm's own region of the
   workspace so the source wrist still has joint range left at the moment of the pour.
5. **Aim.** The pouring lip — the rim point the beads leave from, which moves and drops as the cup
   turns — is brought over the receiver mouth and above its rim.
6. **Pour.** The source cup is turned until the beads leave it and fall into the receiver.
   **How far it has to be turned is not something this reward knows.** The release angle depends on
   the fill level, on the bead pile, on where exactly the lip sits and on how fast the cup is turning;
   the only thing that can be measured without guessing is *whether beads came out and where they
   went*. So from this round on, the angle is the policy's business and the beads are the reward's.
7. **Hold the grasp the whole way.** The grasp that lifted the cup has to survive the rotation — the
   hand is small and the fingertip pinch is the only thing holding the cup while it is upside down.
8. **Finish.** The source empties, the receiver holds what it received, both cups stop moving, and
   nothing is dropped.

## 2. What the i16g run says

The good news first, because it decides what must NOT be touched:

* **The warm-started grasp survived.** `task/src_grasped` 0.75, `task/rcv_grasped` 0.82 for the whole
  2100 epochs; `task/src_cup_lift` 0.21-0.27 m. Grasp, lift, converge, carry and align are healthy
  (`reward/align_mouths` 3.12, `reward/converge` 2.26, `reward/carry_src` 1.93).
* **The rendezvous moved, exactly as iter_16 intended.** `diag_frac_rcv` fell monotonically
  1.047 → 0.57-0.63 with no oscillation, `diag_src_limit_hit` stayed ≤ 0.05 and
  `diag_src_margin_min` 0.126. The wrist pin of the warm lineage was a habit, and it is gone.
* **The policy IS learning to pour.** The training averages are mixed with exploration noise
  (`task/src_tilt_deg` 37 mean), but the deterministic replay at ep2100 shows tilt 87.6°,
  `in_target` 0.150, spill 0.050, source residue 0.756. At ep900 the same replay was 23.4° and 0.000.

And the failure, which the logs price out exactly:

| paid for holding an ATTITUDE | per step | paid for DELIVERING beads | per step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tilt_near` (W 6.0) | +0.731 | `pour_delta` (W 150 × Δin_target) | +0.001 |
| `aimed_tilt` (W 2.5) | +0.313 | `transferred` (W 5.0 × in_target) | +0.009 |
| `pour_tilt` (W 10.0) | +0.258 | `transfer_tail` (W 4.0) | +0.000 |
| `tilt_aim` (W 2.0) | +0.556 | `src_emptied` (W 3.0) | +0.000 |
| `pour_pose` (W 5.0) | +0.217 | | |
| **≈ +2.07** | | **≈ +0.010** | |

**Attitude income is 200× delivery income.** Standing in the corridor with the cup turned and nothing
coming out is worth two full points a step; a bead actually arriving is worth 0.0075 of a step's
`pour_delta`. That is the whole story of `task/episode_success` = 0 for 2100 epochs.

The operator's second observation — *"it starts pouring, no beads go in, and then it rights the cup"* —
has the same cause, and it is **not** `settle_finish` (that term pays +0.001/step and `diag_finish_q`
is 0.004, i.e. it is switched off). It is the fill-coupled ladder at `compute_reward.py:409-412`:

```
release_tilt = 75° + 25° × (1 − bead_in_source_frac)
```

At the measured residue 0.756 the prescribed release angle is ≈ 81° while the cup is actually at
87.6°: the policy is already at the **top** of the band it is paid for. Turning further enters
`overtilt` (W 6.0). And if no beads come out, `tilt_near`/`pour_tilt`/`pour_pose` are maximised by
*coming back down* into the middle of the band. The reward literally pays for the retreat.

Two smaller readings that shape this round:

* `close_src` 0.087/step: the fingertips do not stay inside 3 cm of the pinch point for long. The
  grasp term `grasp_src` is multiplied by `pose_ok_src`, which was the tilt corridor — so the further
  the cup turns, the less the reward cares about the grasp. Exactly backwards.
* `entropy` collapsed 21.9 → 3.5. Removing income must therefore be paired with income that the
  warm start can collect **immediately**, or the run boots into a flat landscape.

## 3. What iter_17 changes

The user's instruction is explicit: *the pour angle must be discovered by learning, not specified by
the reward.* This round therefore does four things and keeps everything else verbatim.

### 3.1 Every angle prescription is deleted

Removed outright, with no replacement:

| removed | what it was |
|---|---|
| `release_tilt`, `theta_pre`, `theta_max` | the fill-coupled 75°+25° release ladder and its two margins |
| `tilt_aim` (W 2.0) | income for reaching a fraction of `theta_pre` |
| `tilt_near` (W 6.0) | income for the `theta_pre` → release segment |
| `pour_tilt` (W 10.0) | income for the release → release+30° segment |
| `pour_pose` (W 5.0) | the plateau that paid for *holding* the release attitude |
| `aimed_tilt` (W 2.5) | income for being inside the pre-release angle window |
| `overtilt` (W 6.0) | the penalty above release + 20° |
| `early_tilt` (W 0.8) | the penalty on the magnitude above the allowed corridor |
| `mis_tilt` (W 1.6) | a penalty on the *magnitude* of misdirected tilt |
| the `allowed` corridor / `src_up` / `src_up_soft` | the attitude window that gated `grasp_src` and `lift_src` |
| `upright_src` in `settle_finish` | an attitude prescription for the finish pose |

The signed tilt `theta` and the attitude corridor's diagnostics survive **only as diagnostics**
(`diag_theta_deg`, `diag_mis_deg`, `diag_src_tilt_deg`); nothing in the sum reads an angle target.

The one place an attitude still appears is the knock-over guard on a cup that is **still on the
table**, and it reuses `UPRIGHT_TOL` — the environment's own 20° receiver-upright criterion, not a
new pour constant:

```
pose_ok_src = carry_soft_src + (1 − carry_soft_src) · exp(−(src_cup_tilt / UPRIGHT_TOL)²)
```

Once the cup is carried this is exactly 1: **while the source cup is in the air the reward has no
opinion about its attitude at all.** On the table, tilting it means tipping it over, and that is a
safety gate, not a pour angle.

Checked on a swept state (both cups grasped and carried, spout over the receiver, **no beads moving**,
source tilt 0° → 149°): the total reward moves by 1.07 over the whole range, and every bit of that
comes from `align_mouths` (0.90) and `carry_src` (0.17) — i.e. from `d_align`, the distance of the
**lip point** to the aim point 4 cm above the receiver rim. The lip physically moves through space as
the cup rotates, so that coupling is geometric and the policy can null it by moving the cup; it is not
an angle target, and the same swept state gains **+5.0 the moment one bead is delivered**. Under
iter_16 the same sweep paid up to +2.07/step for the angle alone with nothing coming out.

### 3.2 Pouring is paid for the beads only

Income that a tilt can earn, after this round:

* `pour_delta` = 150 × flow-capped Δ`in_target` → **+7.5 per bead**, unchanged (operator note 6).
* `transferred` = **8.0** × `in_target` × clean × upright × not-nested (was 5.0).
* `transfer_tail` = 4.0 × `_late_ramp(in_target, 0.10, 0.90)` (TAIL_LO 0.35 → **0.10**).
* `src_emptied` = 3.0 × `_late_ramp(1 − fill, 0.20, 1.0)` × fill_ok (EMPTY_LO 0.45 → **0.20**).
* minus `spill_delta` (240, **unchanged**), `flow_excess` (40, unchanged), `unaimed_release` (below).

The three constants that moved are read straight off the deterministic ep2100 replay, which is the
state the new run boots from:

| constant | old | new | derivation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W_TRANSFER` | 5.0 | 8.0 | at the measured `in_target` = 0.150 this pays 8.0 × 0.150 × clean 0.80 = **0.96/step**, against the **2.07/step** of attitude income that was just deleted. The replacement is roughly half the size, and unlike the old income it is zero unless beads are actually in the receiver. |
| `TAIL_LO` | 0.35 | 0.10 | `diag_fill_tail` was 0.0000 for the entire run because 0.35 is above everything the policy reaches. 0.10 sits **below** the measured 0.150, so the ramp is already positive (+0.13/step) and rising at the warm-start state. `TAIL_HI` 0.90 is unchanged and still above the env's 0.80 success threshold. |
| `EMPTY_LO` | 0.45 | 0.20 | measured emptied = 1 − 0.756 = **0.244** at ep2100, so 0.45 was unreachable (`diag_empty_q` 0.006). 0.20 is just below the measured value: +0.09/step now, and every further bead out of the source is worth more than the last. |

Net at the warm-start state: about −2.07 (attitude) + 0.20 (its penalties) + 1.14 (delivery) ≈ −0.7/step,
and the whole remaining 1.14 moves only when beads move. At a *failed* pour — cup turned, nothing
coming out — the policy now loses the full 2.07 and gains nothing, which is the point.

### 3.3 Geometry survives only as permission, in cup-radius multiples

* `perm_xy` — the lip inside 1.0 → 3.0 `cup_radius` of the receiver mouth: **unchanged**.
* `lead_gate` — 1.75 → 5.0 `cup_radius`: **unchanged**.
* the vertical half of the permission window is now written in radii too:
  `LIP_Z_HI_R = 0.7` replaces the absolute `LIP_Z_HI = 0.02 m`. At the nominal 0.030 m inner radius
  of these 6 cm shakers this is 0.021 m and at 0.028 m it is 0.0196 m — the **same 2 cm window used
  since iter_06**, now expressed so that it survives a change of cup.
* direction is a **sign gate only**: `toward = (theta > 0)`, multiplied into `perm`. It carries no
  value as a magnitude — tilting *more* toward the receiver earns nothing.

`unaimed_release` keeps its name and its job but changes its trigger, exactly as the operator asked:
it used to fire on an *angle window* (`pre_release`), and now it fires on an **actual release**:

```
release_step = clamp(d_in_target, 0) + clamp(d_spill, 0)     # beads that left the source this step
unaimed_release = −60.0 · settled · release_step · (1 − perm)
```

`W_UNAIMED` 3.0 → **60.0**, because the quantity it multiplies changed from a dimensionless window
(O(1)) to a bead fraction (1/20 per bead). In per-bead units — the units the rest of the bead block
is written in — this is **−3 per bead released outside the window**, against `pour_delta` +7.5 and
`spill_delta` −12: letting go while the spout is not over the receiver mouth is never profitable,
and the charge stays well under the spill charge so "where the bead ended up" remains the dominant
signal.

### 3.4 The grasp is paid for surviving the pour

Two changes, both from the operator's ep2100 observation that the grasp looks unstable:

* `close_src` was multiplied by the tilt corridor and therefore faded out exactly when the cup was
  turning. With `pose_ok_src` = 1 while carried, it is now **live through the whole pour**, and
  `W_CLOSE_SRC` goes 0.3 → **0.6** to match `W_CLOSE_RCV` (no new constant is introduced; the measured
  `close_src` 0.087/step simply doubles to ≈ 0.18).
* a new `grip_hold_src` / `grip_hold_rcv` pays for keeping the contact **distribution** that lifted
  the cup, for as long as the cup is carried:

```
balance   = min(f_thumb, f_others) / (max(f_thumb, f_others) + eps)    # RATIO, never an absolute force
grip_keep = grasped · exp(−(d_grip / 0.03)²) · (0.3 + 0.7 · balance)
```

  This follows the sibling track's i24 rule verbatim: **no absolute force criterion** — the grasp flag
  already establishes that there is contact, and the reward only looks at how that contact is
  *distributed* between thumb and fingers, plus whether the pinch centre is still at the grip point
  in the **cup frame** (so it stays valid while the cup is upside down).
  `W_GRIP_HOLD_SRC = 1.2`, `W_GRIP_HOLD_RCV = 0.6`: at the measured hold
  (`src_grasped` 0.76, `near_grip` ≈ 0.8, thumb 3-5 N vs fingers 2.5-5 N → balance ≈ 0.7) this is
  1.2 × 0.76 × 0.8 × 0.79 ≈ **0.58/step** for the source and ≈ 0.3 for the receiver — under the
  −1/+1 per-step budget for new terms, and far below the delivery income it must not outbid.

### 3.5 Kept verbatim (operator keep-list)

`approach_lip` and the approach/permission split · `meet_cross` (5.0) and `src_cross` (0.8) ·
`converge` (3.0), `carry_src` (3.0), `align_mouths` (5.0) · `grasp` (2.0), both lift bands,
`over_lift`, `hold_rcv` · `src_speed` 0.5, `src_spin` 0.5, `rot_pour` 1.0, `rcv_spin` 0.5 ·
`palm_sat` 3.0/1.5, `palm_bang` 1.5/2.0, `act_flip`, `hand_flip`, `carry_rate`, `action_rate` ·
`arm_limit` 0.4 and `arm_shake` 0.4 · `cup_disturb_rcv`, `rcv_home`, `rcv_still`, `upright_rcv` ·
`spill_delta` 240, `flow_excess` 40, `success_bonus` 20 · `cup_collision`, `hand_foreign`, `nested`,
`near_nested`, `rush_near_cup`, `cup_fling`, `contact_push`.

One gate inside a kept term had to be rewritten because its old gate was an angle: `rot_pour` was
gated on `aim_frac` (a fraction of `theta_pre`). Its free speed 1.0 rad/s, scale 1.5 and weight 1.0
are untouched; the gate is now `ctrl_gate · lead_gate · perm_xy`, i.e. "both cups carried and the
spout inside the aiming window", entirely in cup-radius multiples.

**Expected movement:** `reward/total` drops ~2/step at once (that is the attitude income leaving).
`diag_src_tilt_deg` becomes free and may wander early — it is no longer steered. The metrics to watch
are `bead/in_target`, `diag_release_beads` and `diag_unaimed_beads`: if the policy keeps turning the
cup, the first must rise and the third must stay near zero. `diag_frac_rcv` should stay at 0.57-0.63
and `diag_src_limit_hit` ≤ 0.05.
