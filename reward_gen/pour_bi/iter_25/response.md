# iter_25 — reward for "pour the requested amount, then stand the cup back up"

## 1. What the task means and which stages the robot must pass

**Goal of this round.** The episode is no longer "empty the cup". The environment samples a
requested amount (`pour_target_beads` / `pour_target_frac`, also observed by the actor) and the
episode succeeds only when the transferred amount is within one bead of that request, the source cup
is back near upright, BOTH cups are still grasped, and the old safety conditions hold (little spill,
cups close but never touching, not nested, no premature-tilt latch, pour direction not away from the
body, receiver near upright and on its own side).

**Stages.**

1. **Reach** — each palm moves to its own cup (two independent terms, both arms in parallel).
2. **Grasp** — close the fingers near the cup until thumb + another finger press (`*_grasped`), with
   an enveloping contact (middle/distal links, `*_wrap_count >= 3`) rather than a fingertip pinch.
3. **Lift** — both cups leave the table. The moment the source cup is first lifted the environment
   records the grasp reference (hand pose in cup coordinates, force share, force total); from then
   on the job of the hand is to *keep that same grasp*, because that is what survives the rotation.
4. **Transport / aim** — the source cup is carried until its **pouring lip** (`src_pour_lip_pos`,
   which already accounts for the tilt) sits over and above the receiver's mouth, on a pour
   direction that is not away from the body, while the receiver stays upright on its own side.
   The work must stay near the centre line (head-camera view), so the source cup is charged for
   crossing far to the receiver's side, and the receiver is paid for staying on its own side
   near its spawn row — the two pressures make them meet near y ≈ 0.
5. **Pour the requested amount** — beads leave the tilted source cup through the air and land in
   the receiver. This is driven **only by the flow**: every bead that arrives *while it is still
   needed* is paid; every bead that arrives *past the request* is charged about twice as much, so
   emptying the cup is no longer the safe choice. No target angle appears anywhere — the angle that
   releases beads depends on the fill, the bead size and the cup, so the policy has to find it. The
   only rotation shaping is "tip the cup while you are aimed and still need beads", expressed as
   the cup's own up-axis (a dimensionless [0,1] measure), and it switches off by itself the moment
   the request is met.
6. **Finish** — with the transferred amount inside the one-bead tolerance
   (`tol = 1 / bead_active_count`, taken from `ctx`), income is paid for bringing the source cup
   back upright and keeping BOTH cups held and the receiver upright. This is the sustained
   attractor of the episode and is exactly the state the environment calls success.

**Safety throughout** — the cups must never touch (force + latch), each hand may touch only its own
cup, the grasped source cup must not exceed the environment's own premature-tilt limit while it is
not yet aimed (used as a *fraction of `ctx.premature_tilt_limit`*, never as an angle), and the
control charges (action rate / sign flips, arm joint-speed tremor with a 3x heavier weight on the
receiver arm) are ramped in on `adr_progress` so a fresh run explores freely.
